# Intelligent Form Features Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of intelligent form features for the Infra Mind assessment forms, as specified in task 8.2. The implementation enhances user experience through smart defaults, auto-completion, contextual help, and progressive disclosure functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Defaults Based on Industry Patterns and Company Size

**Backend Implementation:**
- `IntelligentFormService` class in `src/infra_mind/forms/intelligent_features.py`
- Industry-specific patterns for technology, healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing
- Company size-specific patterns for startup, small, medium, large, and enterprise
- Combined context analysis for more accurate suggestions

**Key Capabilities:**
- Budget range suggestions based on industry and company size
- Cloud provider recommendations based on industry preferences
- Compliance requirements based on industry regulations
- Infrastructure maturity suggestions based on company size
- Technical team size recommendations based on combined context

**Example:**
```python
# Healthcare company gets HIPAA compliance suggestions
context = {"industry": "healthcare"}
defaults = service.get_smart_defaults("compliance_requirements", context)
# Returns: [{"value": "hipaa", "confidence": 0.9, "reason": "Required for healthcare industry"}]
```

### 2. Auto-completion and Suggestion Features

**Backend Implementation:**
- Suggestion system with confidence scoring
- Query-based filtering for real-time suggestions
- Context-aware suggestions based on form data
- Categorized suggestions for better organization

**Key Capabilities:**
- Company name suggestions with descriptions
- AI use case suggestions with categories
- Cloud service suggestions with technical details
- Query filtering for real-time search
- Industry-specific suggestions

**Example:**
```python
# Get AI use case suggestions for healthcare
context = {"industry": "healthcare"}
suggestions = service.get_suggestions("ai_use_cases", "predict", context)
# Returns healthcare-specific predictive analytics suggestions
```

### 3. Contextual Help and Guidance System

**Backend Implementation:**
- Comprehensive help database with examples and tips
- Context-customized help based on user profile
- Related field suggestions for better navigation
- Multiple help types (tooltip, modal, inline)

**Key Capabilities:**
- Field-specific help with examples and tips
- Industry-specific guidance (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare)
- Company size-specific recommendations
- Related field suggestions for workflow guidance

**Example:**
```python
# Get contextual help for compliance requirements
context = {"industry": "healthcare"}
help_info = service.get_contextual_help("compliance_requirements", context)
# Returns customized help with healthcare-specific tips
```

### 4. Progressive Disclosure and Save-and-Resume Functionality

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Field visibility based on context and dependencies
- Priority-based field ordering
- Conditional field display based on user selections
- Reduced cognitive load through smart field management

**Save-and-Resume:**
- `FormStateManager` class for state persistence
- Auto-save functionality with configurable intervals
- Multiple saved forms per user
- Form restoration with progress tracking

**Key Capabilities:**
- Hide compliance fields for non-regulated industries
- Show advanced fields only for mature companies
- Auto-save every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Resume from any saved point
- Multiple saved assessments per user

    type="select"
    value={formData.industry}
    onChange={(value) => handleInputChange('industry', value)}
    options={industryOptions}
    formContext={formData}
    onGetSmartDefaults={getSmartDefaults}
    onGetSuggestions={getSuggestions}
    onGetContextualHelp={getContextualHelp}
/>
```

### 2. ProgressSaver Component

**File:** `frontend-react/src/components/ProgressSaver.tsx`

**Features:**
- Auto-save with visual indicators
- Manual save functionality
- Saved forms list with completion percentages
- Form restoration with progress tracking
- Delete saved forms functionality

**Usage:**
```tsx
<ProgressSaver
    formId={formId}
    currentStep={activeStep}
    formData={formData}
    totalSteps={steps.length}
    onSave={saveProgress}
    onLoad={loadProgress}
    onDelete={deleteProgress}
    onListSaved={listSavedForms}
    autoSaveInterval={30000}
/>
```

### 3. Enhanced Assessment Form

**File:** `frontend-react/src/app/assessment/page.tsx`
