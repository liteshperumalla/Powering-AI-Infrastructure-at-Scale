# Infra Mind: AI Infrastructure Advisory Platform

## Problem
Businesses struggle with AI infrastructure planning and scaling decisions due to complex multi-cloud environments, cost optimization challenges, and compliance requirements. Organizations lack strategic guidance for efficiently architecting, deploying, and scaling AI systems across different cloud providers.

## Approach
Implements a multi-agent AI system featuring specialized agents (CTO, Cloud Engineer, Research, Report) that collaboratively analyze infrastructure requirements, provide real-time cloud provider comparisons, and generate strategic recommendations. Uses intelligent orchestration to deliver comprehensive infrastructure assessments and optimization strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with multi-agent orchestration
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB + Redis for caching
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration, LangChain
- **Cloud APIs**: AWS, Azure, GCP provider integrations
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, NGINX load balancing

## Quickstart

### Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/liteshperumalla/Powering-AI-Infrastructure-at-Scale.git
cd Powering-AI-Infrastructure-at-Scale

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (OpenAI, cloud providers)
```

### Run
```bash
# Deploy development environment
make deploy-dev

# Access services
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Results & Metrics
- **Multi-Agent System**: 4 specialized AI agents with distinct roles and expertise
- **Cloud Coverage**: Real-time analysis across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent recommendations for infrastructure spend reduction
- **Compliance Mapping**: Automated requirement assessment and gap analysis
- **Report Generation**: Professional, actionable infrastructure strategy reports
- **Production Ready**: Full Docker containerization with CI/CD workflows
